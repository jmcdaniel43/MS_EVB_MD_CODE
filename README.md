# Reactive_PB_NN_MD
This is a reactive molecular dynamics code based on PB-NN potentials, in which neural networks are utilized in the off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian to mediate the chemical reactions.

This code uses a custom update algorithm to calculation PME forces for the diabatic states in the Hamiltonian matrix.
